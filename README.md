# Urban sound excerpts classification
## Classification of sounds excerpts using several Machine learning and Deep learning algorithms

This project majorly is done entirely in a jupyter notebook, in a local machine. So in order to replicate the same, required packages should be installed into the current enviornment.

- **Urban_Sound_Classification.ipynb** :- Notebook containing several experimations on the data such as audio features extraction, data visualization, model design, hyper-parameters tuning and evaluation.

- **feature_df.csv** :- CSV file consisting several audio features extracred from the data using various Audio processing methods, can be loaded for faster process.


- **UrbanSound8K_README.txt.ipynb** :- Readme file provided by the author of the dataset.


**NOTE:- All the file paths are relative to my local PC, change the file paths after downloading the dataset in order to run on your machine.**
